we have designed schema such as we will be having all the required user and product and sellers data and with the help of these tables we can sell the product with discounts and also we have used delivery table to store the address and contact details of the user to deliver the product to the customer.
we have also normalized the tables to avoid duplication or repetitions of values upto 3NF
we have connected or joined all the tables to each other as per the requirement.
